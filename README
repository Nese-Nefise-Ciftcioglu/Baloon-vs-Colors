-Control your balloon by tapping and holding down the screen.

-The color of the balloon will change with each wall you pass. You should keep track of its color. 

-Avoid other colors than the balloon has and black parts of the walls. 

-Speed will be increased gradually.

-Be careful! Because this is a balloon, it is too light. Therefore,  if you press too long, your ballon will hit the black ceilings and burst. 

-Blue bubbles are hellium which means if you take them, controls of the game will be reversed until you get another one.

-If your score reaches at least 10, you get a second chance! If the little heart icon shows up on left top of your screen, that means you can pass through a wrong color for once.
